## PROJECT PROGRESSION REPORT FOR AUTOMATED DATA ANALYSIS SYSTEM  
## Project description:  
This project will provide services to different users who want to collect, analyse, visualize gain
insight and discover predictive capability hidden in their data. The platform will allow users to
upload data, perform data analysis and visualization and perform preliminary predictive
modelling. In addition, the system will allow users to download reports in different format  
Completed system requirements: 

From the short description of the system, we have completed the following system requirements:  
- User can register and login to system  
- User can upload file(dataset) to the system.  
- Design the dashboard for the user to work on. 
### Remained system requirements:  
Referring to pre-defined system requirements there are some of requirements that are not implemented, which are:  
- Data analysis and visualization  
- Generate report and save to the database 
- View data and delete  
- Download clean data   
- Download report  

For the time remained, we will try to complete the remained system functional requirements. 
In developing the system we are using different tools for front end and back end.  
### Front end tools:  
- html5  
- css3  
- javascript  
- jquery  
- bootstrap framework  
### Back end tools:  
- python(basics,filesystem,os,)  
- Django framework(this is a web framework for python)  
- Data analysis tools(numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn,scipy)  
- mysql   
### Challenge:  
 During developing our system we are facing some challenges which  reduces development speed, that is due to the fact
 that we have to learn some of tools mentioned and use them in development which is limited by time.
